My naming scheme is that my main function is labeled "main", global
function are labeled "_globalfunctionname", and methods are labeled
"_Classname.Methodname". 

Otherwise, this extends onto the functionality that I built for pp3. I
store the scoping information, the current class, and all of the other
information that I used and/or collected during the semantic analysis for
each node in that same node during semantic analysis. That way, on the
next tree traversal for code generation, this information is all set up
and ready for the code generator to use. 

The code generation revolves around the virtual Emit function, but I also
use a lot of helper functions such as MakeLocation, ReadValue, etc.
